## How can I edit this code?

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/1ba99e6e-0129-4983-8dbb-db0a56d433e9) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Commit changes to Github**

```shell
# Step 1 check which files have changed and that you want to commit
git status 

# Step 2 add your changes to staging area (ready to commit)
git add <file1> <file2> ...

# Step 3
git commit -m "descriptive message about changes here!"

# Step 3b Alternatively, if you want to commit ALL files and skip 2 you can run
git commmit -a -m "descriptive message about changes here!"

# Step 4
git push origin
```

Ensure to check your github repo to see that your repo is in sync and that actions have been triggered accordingly.
